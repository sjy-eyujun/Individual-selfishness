# Individual-selfishness
## Introduction  


This is the source code for paper Individual selfishness drives microbial community succession.All the code mentioned here is used for the analysis in this article.  

Firstly, save the file to the same folder, open MATLAB and run main. m for simulation. The result file will be saved to 'aving_filename' on line 16 of main. Readers can modify the model parameters based on the information in Supplementary Table 1. After the simulation is completed, the simulation results can be observed and analyzed in animation form by running data_imaging. m.
